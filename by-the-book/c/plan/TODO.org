* lox extensions
** integers
** arrays
** hashmaps
** line, col debug info
** TODO nicer for-loops
at least copy lua
* implement lambda solver
** implement bigints
** bind to libgmp, add extern-c support; COMPARE with hand-rolled bigint implementation
** competitive solutions (beat the print(value) crowd)
* transgirl's transpiler
the only goal is to get big point on code.golf
** compile to Python, Lua, other similar languages, Berry, Go, unholy Rust, C, code.golf x86
** write C compiler yasssssssss
** implement some codegolf in lox, run locally, run against ALL HOLES and make sure each output language has good quality
    config: hasNativeBigInt, use X algorithm here/there, hasNativeHashmaps
* implement a byte compression algorithm in lox
* code quality
`-Werror=switch` is so dope
** DONE add tests against .lox code files
** add C linters, analyzers, the whole shebang
** add github actions, binaries for windows, riscv, arm, x86, arch package
